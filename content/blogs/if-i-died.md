Summary: If I died right now, how long would it take you to notice?

If I died right now, how long would it take you to notice?

Let's clarify. If I died on some random spot on Duke's campus during a week of classes in a way such that no one saw my death or found my body, when would you notice that I'm missing?

Yes, you, the anonymous reader. How long would it take *you*?

There's two possible ways you could find out about my death. First, you could independently find out about my death solely due to interactions with me. Let's call this *discovery*. 

Some people have an extraordinarily high chance of discovery. Nate (my roommate), for example, would almost certainly notice my absence. Missing for a night or two and not responding to texts would be enough for him to realize.

Others come to mind too. My mom would find out pretty soon: she once tried to contact campus faculty after I forgot to check the family group chat for a few days. Admittedly, that was right after move-in, so she was on-edge about me leaving home. But it would still realistically take her and the rest of my nuclear family less than a week. Probably 3-4 days at most, honestly.

An aspect to also consider is that I have a fairly stable schedule. I nearly always go to class, I nearly always go to the dining halls at the same times, and I nearly almost always do homework in the same spots. There's people that you're surprised to see, and there's people that you're surprised to *not* see. I'm likely in the latter category. 

As such, my friends in my classes would notice my absence fairly quickly. They might text after I first miss a class together, and then get slightly concerned after I miss two classes in a row and still haven't responded. After the third or fourth class, I think they'd start investigating - especially because some of them have location sharing enabled with me. 

But you don't need to directly find out about my death. The second way that you could find out - indeed the way that the majority of people would find out - would be through someone else who knew about it. Let's call your chance of finding out from other people your *inward network effect* and your chance of telling other people your *outward network effect*.

The size of your inward network effect basically boils down to (a) how many mutual friends we have, (b) their chance of discovery and the size of their inward network effect, (c) how close they are to you, and (d) how close you are to me.<sup>[1]</sup> The former two factors address the likelihood that you have friends who know about my death, and the latter two address the likelihood that your friends act on that knowledge to tell you. This implies that all of the factors must be present in some aspect; your inward network effect is zero if your friends don't find out about my death and is equally zero if our only mutual contacts are distant acquaintances.

The size of your outward network effect must rely on similar factors. After all, the size of your outward network effect is directly proportional to the size of other people's inward effect. But I think your closeness to me grows in importance. My family is rather close to me, and I think they would tell distant relatives and their friends nigh-instantly, even though I may barely know many of those people. 

It's a pretty fun thought experiment to consider how long it'd take each person. Friends from high school have medium-ish discovery odds and low inward network effects, so it might take them a while. Their saving grace is location sharing and the very few mutual friends that go to Duke.

Online friends who I used to play video games with? Laughably low discovery chances and functionally-nonexistent inward network effects. They genuinely might never find out.

It's hard to put into words what exactly each person's time-till-knowing encapsulates. It's not exactly a measure 

# Footnotes

[1] Of note is that this implies the size of someone's inward network effect is only loosely correlated with their chance of discovery. In general, yes, if you have a higher chance of discovery (i.e., if you spend more time with me), you know more of my social network. But there are obvious exceptions: Nate and my family both have very minimal contact with my main social networks. Their chance of discovery is high, but their network effects are tiny. If my friends found out first, my family or Nate would still probably have their normal time till discovery.
