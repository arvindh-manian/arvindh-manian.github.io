Summary: This is one paragraph just read it

I want to start blogging more often. I suspect the roadblock is that I'm blocked by my own desire to write _really really_ good, meaningful posts. That shouldn't be the point. Really like how my friend [Aum](https://aumken.github.io) does it. Will probably writing more, shorter blogs. Hopefully that leads me to occasionally also write a longer one.
