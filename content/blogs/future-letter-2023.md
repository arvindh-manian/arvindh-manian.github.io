Summary: I reflect on what I would like my future to be like. I further reflect on how to get there.

Dear Future Me,

You are entering into this agreement. This is not of your own volition, but most of the values in this will be time-consistent enough that I believe you will still desire to hold yourself to it.

This was inspired by [this post](https://goodreason.substack.com/p/an-infinity-of-choices). The idea is basically that there's _way_ more possibilities than there is time, and you need to commit to a few. An interesting part of that is you need to actively choose to _not_ participate in some that you're pretty interested in, as they distract you from the ones that you assess at a higher value.

I agree. So let's do it.

## Objectives

My objectives are mostly undebatable. I think the vast majority of people have similar objectives, and I will be surprised if future me disagrees with any. The ultimate goal is happiness, but all of these objectives should be pretty intrinsically linked to happiness.

Mine are:

1. Be friends with interesting people.
2. Find a fulfilling career.

I think falling in love is also probably an objective, but strategies to do that will likely also solve (1).

## Strategies

These are slightly more debateable. These should be ways to pursue the objectives that current me is fairly certain are strong ways. Perhaps future me will find that there are stronger ways, but the point of this contract is that I _stick to specific ones._ I doubt future me will actively think that any of these are horrible.

On objective (1):

a) Meet interesting people in a way that maximizes chance of a future friendship with them. Think [microfriendships](https://colah.github.io/personal/micromarriages/).

b) Make myself more interesting.

c) Maintain existing friendships

On objective (2):

a) Explore for a bit

b) [Exploit]((https://joshkaufman.net/explore-exploit/)

## Specific Implementations

On 1a:

-   Rush stuff next semester. Rushing is objectively a way to quickly befriend a significant number of people outside your typical social circle. Not sure what to rush yet, but investigate. Ask Nate?
-   Get deep into clubs. Specifically, go deep into HackDuke, as that seems like a group where there's high potential for friends. Drop robotics. Drop Moot Court. Consider joining Habitat For Humanity.
-   Pursue social hobbies. Rock climbing, word hunt, working out, and chess should all be continued. Drop other social hobbies: freestyle frisbee. Others?

On 1b:

-   Pursue solo hobbies. Ukulele. Read blog posts on rationality & hackernews/lobste.rs. Watch TV once in a while. Blog. No other solo hobbies: beatboxing. Others?
-   Be more spontaneous. Genuinely consider opportunities before saying no. Impossible to come up w specific goals for this.

On 1c:

-   Reach out to friends more. Include them in social hobbies. Vary who you ask. Consider Google Sheet of who you've asked and when.

On 2a:

-   Coffee chat ppl and check vibes of different professions.
-   Ask friends who have done the research about what they think of different fields.
-   Try out activities for different professions. Econ 256 next sem. ITP this sem.

On 2b:

-   Reach out again to whoever original coffee chat in (2a) was.
-   Do activities that align with that career path. Probably one club and possibly research.
-   Do general things that will probably carry over regardless of role. Work on communication. Work on presentation.

## Conclusion

That seems like about it. Will revisit this in a couple days and see if I feel like it's still worth following. If so, the contract is that I will follow this for the next three months. Future me will have to deal with the opportunity costs of things I miss out on, while present me will have to do the work to pursue different goals.
